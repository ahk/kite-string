Development status: don't use this yet!
  For now the only client being developed is command line, but that's really not the final word on computer interfaces is it?
  
Requirements: 
  - node.js, DNode (node.js lib)
  - websockets set up in your targeted web browser and application code
  
Reason:
  Why shouldn't web browser sessions be able to hang out with the outside world? Web apps are inherently networked, there should be simple interfaces for talking to them live.
